                <li>
                    If you must get on public Wi-Fi, your best bet is to get a VPN. VPNs are a secure way
                    of surfing the net by first connecting to a VPN server before venturing onto the Internet.
                </li>
                <li>Another good rule of thumb is to only visit websites secured with HTTPS</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                Finally, it‚Äôs important that whenever you are done connecting to a public Wi-Fi network that you
                configure your phone or computer to ‚Äòforget‚Äô that network.
